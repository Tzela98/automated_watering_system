This project is supposed to run an off grid automated watering system in our garden using an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP controls valves via its GPIO pins to allow watering of different watering zones in the garden that can be pre-configured. In addition sensors will be installed to measure the amount of water dumped on the soil so that different plant needs can be met accordingly. The ESP will also act as an access point to update instructions via a webserver.
