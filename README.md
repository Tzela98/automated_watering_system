This project is supposed to run an off grid automated watering system in our garden using an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP controls valves via its GPIO pins to allow watering of different watering zones in the garden that can be pre-configured. In addition sensors will be installed to measure the amount of water dumped on the soil so that different plant needs can be met accordingly. The ESP will also act as an access point to update instructions via a webserver.

So far there is a (semi) working webserver so one can water remotely (for a fixed period of time) via a web interface selecting between different watering zones. Right now there still is a bug which does not allow for the watering of the last zones. This needs to be fixed. In addition The next iteration should also allow to set the time for each zones individually and populate a list instead of a dropdown menu. One shpuld also keep in mind, that right now I'm testing on a breadboard with LEDs and not yet with actual valves which of course need different signals (i.e signal to open, nothing, signal to close).
